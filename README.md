### Check out the live link above

### A responsive, mobile friendly image sharing site made specifically for a four legged friend named Bailey!

### Built with Node, Express, MongoDB, and some other stuff. (Deployed with the Heroku CLI and MongoDB Atlas). In the REST environment, CRUD corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively.


#### Visit the site and enjoy the pictures, and if you want, you can upload pics (if you are lucky enough to have any of Bailey)! If not, feel free to just view the uploaded posts.
