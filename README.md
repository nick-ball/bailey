### A responsive, mobile friendly image sharing site made specifically for a four legged friend named Bailey!

### Built with Node, Express, MongoDB, and some other stuff. (Deployed with the Heroku CLI and MongoDB Atlas). In the REST environment, CRUD corresponds to the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, respectively. Utilizing Prototypal Inheritance: "instances inherit directly from other objects. Instances are typically instantiated via factory functions or `Object.create()`. Instances may be composed from many different objects, allowing for easy selective inheritance".
